# Backend for the Task-Management-Application

- A user can add new tasks with a title, description, due date, and priority level (low, medium, high).
- Users should be able to update the status of tasks (to-do, in-progress, completed) and also edit or delete tasks.
- The application should display tasks in a list view, with the ability to sort tasks by due date, priority, or status.
- Implement a feature to export the tasks to a CSV file.
- There should be a history log showing all the changes made to each task (like when it was created, status changes, edits, etc.)
